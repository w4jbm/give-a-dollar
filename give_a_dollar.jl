#
# A Julia tool to studying an interesting scenario by Jim McClanahan W4JBM
#
# The Scenario:
#
# 45 people are each given $45. For 5,000 rounds, each person who has money
# must give $1 to another random person (who is, obviously, not themselves).
#
# The question is what does the distribution of money look like over a long
# period of time. Most people (even those familar with statistics and probability)
# tend to guess that the amount each person has will remain relatively flat.
#
# Surprisingly, this is not what happens...
#
# Individual graphs of the progress are stored and later combined into a GIF.
# I used the Linux convert command to do this. It can be done in Julia but my
# first couple of attempts didn't work, so I fell back to this approach.
#
# I converted my Python version, but one resource I used for that is a version
# in R from dggoldst at:
# https://gist.github.com/dggoldst/e77cacae87a9b88de52f7868936899c5#file-give_a_dollar-r
#
# Translating R to Python was more difficult than it was worth (since I know
# virtually nothing about R), but some of the variable names survived. :-)

# the PNG files are in the right order both with the time stamp
# and when sorted by name.)

    # exhausted" error. Use ffmpeg if you need more frames.
